   <h3> I am a student who is currently puirsuing my studies in college.I was<br>
   in a government school named Kendiya Vidyalaya . My region of Kendriya<br>
   Vidyalaya is Dipatoli Cantt. Since my childhood I was in the same school.<br>
   From class 1st to end of an era in class 12th , it was really very memor-<br>
   -able. There was fun with my friends and all. Our beloved teachers who <br>
   was very kind to us but some were really devil. The people who knows me<br>
   should also know that how badly I got beaten up. But anyways life in school<br>
   was very authentic to us.</h3>

   <h3> In my family I am a single boy with two sisters. Actually my mother<br>
   died when I was less than 2 years old. From then I grew up with my<br>
   grand parents. They never let me feel depressed because they just love <br>
   me alot. It always fascinate me when I ride bike. One of the best thing<br>
   I love to do is playing Football. It is one of my favourite game that<br>
   I ever played. Cooking is really something that I love to do.My aim is<br>
   too high and the work is in progress. One day i'll achieve all my heights.<br></h3>
